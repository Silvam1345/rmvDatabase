# RMV Database Search App

This is a web application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete
clients registered in the Mongo database. 

## How to use the App
On the home page, the user can search for clients via name, status, 
and other filters.

Users can search for specific clients via filters and will be shown a preview of some
of the matched clients' information.

Once the client's name is clicked on, the user can view all the client's information
and has the option to either update the client's info or delete them from the database.

If the user wants to update a client, they'll be directed to a page to modify the 
information and save their changes, and be redirected back to the client's page with
the updated info.
